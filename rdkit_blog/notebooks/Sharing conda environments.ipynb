    "I always encourage people to use the Anaconda Python distribution since conda does such a great job of managing binary dependencies and handling separate environments (well, and because then they won't have to build the RDKit themselves... that makes a *huge* difference for most folks). By this point I think/hope most people know this. What's perhaps less well known is how straightforward it is to *share* a conda environment with someone else. That's what this post is about.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose you've created a script or Jupyter notebook that you would like to share with others. Perhaps you've written a paper and want to allow people to reproduce what you did or you've uploaded a package to GitHub and you want to make it straightforward for others to work with it. As you probably know already, manually capturing and communicating the dependencies for your code can be \"a bit\" of a pain. If you work inside of a conda environment it's easy.\n",

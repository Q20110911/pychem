      "# Substructure fingerprints and the PostgreSQL cartridge\n",
      "\n",
      "The [previous post](http://rdkit.blogspot.ch/2013/11/fingerprint-based-substructure.html) about using fingerprints for substructure screening covered the basics and looked at screenout rates. A more important point is how well the fingerprints perform in a real-world application. The use I will pick here is integration with the RDKit cartridge for PostgreSQL.\n",
      "\n",
      "The RDKit cartridge includes integration with PostgreSQL's [Generalized Search Tree](http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.2/static/gist.html) (GiST) index engine and allows indices to be built for molecule columns that help with substructure search.\n",

      "# Substructure fingerprints and the PostgreSQL cartridge 2: Application to ChEMBL\n",
      "\n",
      "This is a quick addendum to the [previous post](http://rdkit.blogspot.ch/2013/11/substructure-fingerprints-and-cartridge.html) about using fingerprints for substructure screening in the RDKit PostgreSQL cartridge. The earlier post showed performance statistics for my benchmarking data set.\n",

      "These take a lot longer than the previous examples, but the queries are against a much larger set of molecules -- about 1.3 million instead of 50K -- and return many more results. To set expectations, the `zinc_leads`, `zinc_frags`, and `zinc_leads_scaffolds` queries are, theoretically, 645 million comparisons (1.3 million*500).

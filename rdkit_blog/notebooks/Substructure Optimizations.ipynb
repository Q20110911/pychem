    "I had a couple of separate, but related conversations at [Sheffield](https://cisrg.shef.ac.uk/shef2019/) about substructure searching which seemed like they could be combined into a short and hopefully interesting blog post.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first conversation actually started before the meeting: John Mayfield (at NextMove Software) submitted a pull request with some improvements to the RDKit's implementation of the vf2 algorithm, which is what is used to actually do substructure matching. John did a [presentation about speeding up substructure matches](https://www.nextmovesoftware.com/talks/Mayfield_SecretsOfFastSmartsMatching_Sheffield_201906.pdf) at the meeting and implemented some of the improvements he described in his talk for the RDKit. If you're interested in details, here's the [pull request](https://github.com/rdkit/rdkit/pull/2500) that has been merged and will be part of the next release. As I'll show below, this leads to a significant improvement in the performance of the RDKit's substructure matcher. Thanks John!\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, the best way to speed up substructure matching is to not have to do it at all. This is what the RDKit's pattern fingerprint is for, and the second conversation was about how exactly the pattern fingerprint works. Fortunately I'd recently written this up and added it to the RDKit docs. The new [documentation](https://github.com/rdkit/rdkit/blob/master/Docs/Book/RDKit_Book.rst#pattern-fingerprints) is now part of the \"RDKit Book\" and will be in the online documentation for the next release. Here's the version of that documentation as of the writing of this blog post:\n",
    "\n",
    "> These fingerprints were designed to be used in substructure screening. These are, as far as I know, unique to the RDKit. The algorithm identifies features in the molecule by doing substructure searches using a small number (12 in the `2019.03` release of the RDKit) of very generic SMARTS patterns - like `[*]~[*]~[*](~[*])~[*]` or `[R]~1[R]~[R]~[R]~1`, and then hashing each occurence of a pattern based on the atom and bond types involved. The fact that particular pattern matched the molecule at all is also stored by hashing the pattern ID and size. If a particular feature contains either a query atom or a query bond (e.g. something generated from SMARTS), the only information that is hashed is the fact that the generic pattern matched.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">For the `2019.03` release, the atom types use just the atomic number of the atom and the bond types use the bond type, or `AROMATIC` for aromatic bonds).\n",
    ">\n",
    ">NOTE: Because it plays an important role in substructure screenout, the internals of this fingerprint (the generic patterns used and/or the details of the hashing algorithm) may change from one release to the next.\n",
    "\n",
    "Doing this work made me realize that it's been quite a while since I did any benchmarking to see how effective the pattern fingerprint. The last time I looked at this was a series of blog posts in 2013: [here](http://rdkit.blogspot.com/2013/11/fingerprint-based-substructure.html), [here](http://rdkit.blogspot.com/2013/11/substructure-fingerprints-and-cartridge.html), and [here](http://rdkit.blogspot.com/2013/11/substructure-fingerprints-and-chembl.html). There have been a number of changes to the toolkit since then, so it seemed worthwhile to revisit that benchmarking exercise.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since benchmarking screenout performance and substructure search speeds seems like a useful thing to be able to do, I created a new script that will be part of the RDKit source distribution in future releases; that's [here](https://github.com/rdkit/rdkit/blob/master/Regress/Scripts/fingerprint_screenout.py)."

URLs for where to find the data are in the script's source. The datasets themselves are described in the first blog post [mentioned above](http://rdkit.blogspot.com/2013/11/fingerprint-based-substructure.html) (though note that the 25K pairs of molecules are [pulled from ChEMBL21](http://rdkit.blogspot.com/2016/04/revisiting-similarity-comparison-set.html), not ChEMBL16 as in the original post).\n",

    "Now let's look at the impact of John's vf2 changes to the overall runtime. For that we can just look at summary timing information in the last line of the output above and compare it to what I got when I ran the same script using the most recent RDKit release:\n",

The pieces queries, on the other hand, do show a nice improvement: the overall runtime (including the fingerprint screening) drops from 65.5 seconds to 55.4 seconds. The other nice improvement is in the amount of time required to generate the pattern fingerprints for the 50K molecules (column 4): this drops from 24.9 seconds to 16.1 seconds: it's now running in 65% of the time.\n",
